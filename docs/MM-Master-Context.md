## 1. Project Overview

MassageMap is a three-sided massage therapy directory for the South African market. Connects individual therapists and spas (suppliers) with customers, managed via an admin dashboard.

| Side | Description |
|---|---|
| Public / Customer | Browse therapists and spas by province, area, suburb, or map view. No login required. |
| Supplier | Self-registration, profile management, subscription payments, dashboard. |
| Admin | Separate dashboard (hidden URL) to approve, manage, and monitor listings. Johan only. |

- Johan Cilliers is a Chartered Marketer CM(SA) — product positioning, market strategy, and commercial decisions are Johan's domain. Claude executes technical and documentation.
- Never refer to the competitor by name in any documentation, code, chat, or communications — always "the competitor"

## 5. All Decisions — Authoritative Record

Compiled 9 June 2026 from Master Context v20–v47 + session v48. 214 decisions reviewed and confirmed current. Superseded decisions listed at end.

### PLATFORM & ARCHITECTURE

1. Three-sided platform: Public/Customer (no login) / Supplier / Admin (Johan only)
2. `supplierType` = `individual` (therapist) or `spa` — from URL parameter only, no toggle. **Never use `'therapist'` as a value anywhere in code.**
3. Single `suppliers` Firestore collection — do not split. `supplierType` is the differentiator.
4. Single `dashboard.html` — detects supplierType on load, renders correct sections (therapist: 8 sections, spa: 9 sections)
5. Supplier document ID: phone number (e.g. `+27842500422`) — LOCKED as of S2.
6. `uid` field: stored as a field on supplier document but NOT used as document ID
7. Supplier number format: `T-YY-COUNTER` (therapist) / `S-YY-COUNTER` (spa), counter starts at 1001. Two counters in `settings/config`: `counterIndividual` and `counterSpa`.
8. Supplier number generated after Personal section saved — not at OTP
9. `supplierNumber` is permanent — survives deregistration
10. Post-launch expansion to neighbouring African countries — Phase 2
11. Supplier UX principle: 50%+ of suppliers are non-highly-educated smartphone users — simple screens, big buttons, one action per screen
12. Hosting: massagemap.co.za — cPanel on domains.co.za
13. Admin email: admin@massagemap.co.za — replaces Johan's personal email everywhere

### STATUS FIELDS — CRITICAL, NEVER MIX

14. Registration status field name: `status`. Values: `pending` / `active` / `suspended` / `review` / `rejected`
15. Subscription status field name: `subscriptionStatus`. Values: `active` / `expired` / `not_paid`
16. These are two completely separate Firestore fields — NEVER mix them
17. `registrationComplete` Boolean: `false` = lightweight record after Personal section saved. `true` = full registration submitted.
18. `onSupplierRegistered` trigger: `onUpdate` — fires only when `registrationComplete` transitions false → true

### AUTHENTICATION & SESSION

19. 30-day session token in localStorage, key: `mm_session_<phone>`. Contains: displayName, supplierType, expiry.
20. OTP required: first login, new device, or every 30 days — skipped same device within 30 days
21. Sign out ONLY clears Firebase Auth — does NOT delete session token from localStorage
22. New device always requires OTP regardless of 30-day window
23. OTP skip logic: `handleNext` checks `suppliers` first, then `pending_registrations` (silently, auth not required). If found in either with valid session token, skip OTP.
24. Return redirect: if `registrationComplete = false` → redirect to register.html/register-spa.html. If `true` → dashboard.html.

### REGISTRATION FLOW — LOCKED ARCHITECTURE

25. Step 1 — OTP verified: Firebase Auth verifies phone. Session token written to localStorage. `pending_registrations` document created.
26. Step 2 — Consent given: `dataConsentGiven: true` and `dataConsentTimestamp` written to `pending_registrations`.
27. Step 3 — Personal/Business section saved: fields written to `pending_registrations`. `supplierNumber` generated via Firestore transaction. Lightweight `suppliers` document created with `registrationComplete: false`.
28. Step 4 — Remaining sections: each saves to `pending_registrations` via `setDoc merge:true`. Data accumulates progressively.
29. Step 5 — Submit: all fields read from `pending_registrations`. Full `suppliers` document written. `registrationComplete: true`. Cloud Function fires notifications.
30. OTP permissions fix: `pending_registrations` query in `handleNext` wrapped in try/catch to silently ignore permission errors before authentication. Applied to both register.html and register-spa.html.

### POPIA COMPLIANCE — LOCKED

31. `dataConsentGiven` Boolean — captured at consent gate before registration
32. `dataConsentTimestamp` Timestamp — records exact moment consent was given
33. Consent gate fires ONCE before registration. `Begin Registration` button greyed until both checkboxes ticked.
34. Two separate checkboxes: (1) POPIA consent. (2) T&C acceptance. Keeping them separate is correct POPIA practice.
35. Data retention: 60 days after supplier deletion — all personal data purged. Logged in `auditLog`.
36. Legal opinion required PRE-LAUNCH: T&Cs, POPIA compliance, Privacy Policy. Not a DIY task.

### LOCATION

37. Three-level hierarchy: Province → Town → Suburb
38. Areas = optional admin-created clusters within a town — max 5 per town
39. A suburb can only belong to ONE area. Deleting an area returns all suburbs to pool.
40. Area vs suburb rule: if areas exist for town, show area dropdown with "My suburb is not in these areas" escape. If no areas, suburb required directly.
41. Location data: IEC Electoral Commission 2024 — 9 provinces, 189 towns, 8,626 suburbs, zero duplicates confirmed
42. Location Firestore collections: `locations_provinces`, `locations_towns`, `locations_suburbs`, `locations_areas`
43. Firestore field names CRITICAL: `provinceName` (not `province`), `townName` (not `town`), `areaName` (not `name`) in locations_areas
44. `locationArea` field name: LOCKED as of S3. Previously `massageArea` — renamed platform-wide across all files.
45. `locations.json`: retired. **register-spa.html still reads it — update in Phase D spa rebuild ONLY. Do not patch.**
46. Location data = MassageMap core competency — no public write access, admin-only management.

### REGISTRATION — THERAPIST (register.html) — LOCKED SECTION ORDER

### DASHBOARD — LOCKED ARCHITECTURE

64. Single `dashboard.html` detects `supplierType` on load — no separate dashboard-spa.html
65. Therapist dashboard: 8 sections. Spa dashboard: 9 sections.
66. `associationMembership` is multi-select for BOTH therapist and spa — reads dynamically from offerings collection
67. No progress bar on dashboard
68. Services section split deferred to Phase D
69. `displayName` move: from Personal section to About section — editable
70. "Sign Out" button label: must read "Back to Main Menu" — LOCKED
71. Photo storage path: `suppliers/{phone}/photos/{filename}` — LOCKED

### OFFERINGS — LOCKED

72. `massageStyles`: Tantric included for therapists (visibleTo: `['therapist']`). Excluded from spa — never show Tantric in spa registration or dashboard.
73. `visibleTo` values in offerings: `['therapist']` / `['spa']` / `['therapist','spa']`. **Never use `'individual'` in visibleTo.**
74. `amenities` replaces retired `parkingAvailable` and `showerFacilities` booleans — now dynamic from offerings
75. `associations` category seeded into offerings: AHPCSA, MTASA, SAAHIP, SPAASA
76. Adult classification: PERMANENTLY REMOVED. No age gate needed.
77. Enquiry form: PERMANENTLY REMOVED — direct contact only via Call button and WhatsApp button

### PHOTOS — LOCKED (updated 9 June 2026)

78. `facePhotoUrl` field: required close-up face photo. NOT an ID or passport copy. Replaces retired `idPhotoUrl`.
79. `showFacePhoto` Boolean: supplier-controlled. `true` = face photo shown publicly. `false` = face photo hidden.
80. No face photo = no vetting = no live profile. Hard gate, no exceptions.
81. If `showFacePhoto = false` + other photos exist → other photos display, face photo hidden
82. If `showFacePhoto = false` + no other photos → photo space empty on frontend
83. `photos[0]` = face photo slot. `photos[1]` = card photo (public). `photos[2]+` = additional profile photos.
84. facePhotoUrl and showFacePhoto fields — must be added to schema and all code in Phase D

### NOTIFICATIONS — LOCKED

85. Cloud Function is the SOLE sender of all notifications — no frontend notification calls ever
86. SMS only fires for `supplierType === 'individual'` — NOT `type === 'therapist'`
87. Notification names: always `firstName + lastName` — never `displayName` alone
88. Telegram fires on every completed registration (`registrationComplete: true`)

90. Admin email recipient: must be `admin@massagemap.co.za` — currently still going to hjcilliers@gmail.com (Issue #6/#8)

### PAYMENTS — LOCKED

91. PayFast signature generation: NEVER client-side — always via Cloud Function
92. Parameter order is FIXED — any deviation breaks the signature
93. Prices always read from `settings/config` — never hardcoded. `priceIndividual` = 299, `priceSpa` = 999
94. Therapist subscription: R299/month. Spa subscription: R999/month.
95. Manual EFT option in scope for launch — FNB bank account, proof of payment upload, admin approval

97. `severity` values: `critical` / `important` / `low`
98. `reason` field: mandatory for admin actions. Auto-populated for system. Not required for supplier self-service.

106. Spa GPS: device GPS button on registration screen
107. GPS fallback: suburb centroid if street address geocoding fails
108. Separate MarkerClusterer instances per supplier type

### CUSTOMER UX — LOCKED

109. Maximum 4 taps from home to contact — non-negotiable

112. WhatsApp button: only shows if `showWhatsapp = true`
113. No enquiry form — direct contact via Call and WhatsApp only (confirmed 9 June 2026)

### CLOUD FUNCTIONS — DEPLOYED

114. `onSupplierRegistered`: onUpdate — fires when `registrationComplete` transitions false→true
115. `createPayfastPayment`: HTTPS callable — builds signed PayFast payment form
116. `payfastNotify`: HTTPS endpoint — receives PayFast ITN, updates subscription
117. `checkIncompleteRegistrations`: Scheduled every 24h — sends reminder SMS to incomplete registrations
118. `dailyNotificationCheck`: Scheduled 08:00 SAST — checks expiry dates (Phase 2)

## 10. API Reference

*(Full detail in MM-API-Reference-v1.md in Obsidian — critical rules below)*

| Service | Critical rule |
|---|---|
| PayFast | Signature NEVER client-side. Parameter order FIXED. Prices from settings/config only. |
| BulkSMS | SMS only for `supplierType === 'individual'`. Cloud Function only. Credits at ZERO. |
| Resend | Never called from browser. Cloud Function only. Admin recipient must be admin@massagemap.co.za (not yet wired). |
| Telegram | Always `firstName + lastName`. Fires on `registrationComplete: true`. |
| Google Maps | On-demand loading only. Never load globally. |
| Firebase Functions | ALWAYS us-central1. Never africa-south1. |

---

## 11. Workflow Rules

*(Full detail in MM-Workflow-Rules-v1.md in Obsidian — critical rules below)*

1. Every session starts with: review CLAUDE.md → run mmstart → load Master Context → GitHub Issues deep dive
2. Discuss and agree in claude.ai BEFORE any code. Claude never writes code in claude.ai unless Johan explicitly approves.
3. Brief labels: `CLAUDE CODE terminal` or `ZSH terminal` — OUTSIDE the code block, never inside
4. git push: end of session only, or when Johan explicitly asks. Never mid-session.
5. Every field name comes from this document or MM-Field-Register-v1.md. No guessing.
6. Dark theme permanently retired. Never reintroduce.
7. Prices always from settings/config. Never hardcode R299 or R999.
8. Cloud Function is sole notification sender — never from browser.

## Session Log — 10 June 2026

### What we did
- Read MM-Master-Context.md and generated full development plan visual tracker (5 phases, S1–S40)
- Generated MassageMap Dev Plan v1 10Jun2026.docx — saved to docs/ and pushed to GitHub
- Compared original Session Build Plan v1 (19 May) against actual progress — confirmed aligned at end of S6
- Ran live tests on S2 (therapist registration), S3 (spa registration), S6 (therapist dashboard)

### Test results
- S2 Therapist registration: NOT DONE — 11 bugs logged (#32–#37 plus existing #3, #5, #6, #28)
- S3 Spa registration: NOT DONE — 5 bugs (shares root causes with S2)
- S6 Therapist dashboard: NOT DONE — sections 2/4/6/7 save correctly, but OTP loop (#26), location broken (#28), photos broken (#27/#40), associations not loading (#12), travel question missing (#39)
- S6 Spa dashboard: NOT TESTED — deferred until therapist dashboard fixed

### GitHub issues created today
- #32 locationArea saves as null
- #33 area + suburb must both show, selecting one clears other
- #34 province saves lowercase/hyphenated
- #35 welcome email uses displayName not firstName+lastName
- #36 premisesType + mobileAvailable on therapist doc
- #37 referralCode generating — parked feature
- #38 qualifications field not editable in dashboard
- #39 travel question + distance options missing
- #40 photos uploaded during registration not showing in dashboard

### Decisions made
1. Dev Plan kept as separate docx — not merged into Master Context
2. S2, S3, S6 confirmed NOT DONE after live testing
3. Spa dashboard test deferred
4. Fix order agreed: location cascade (#3/#28/#32/#33/#34) → OTP loop (#26) → associations (#12) → admin email (#6/#8) → photos (#27/#40)
5. Both area AND suburb always show on registration — selecting one clears the other
6. Sign out button label must read "Sign Out of Dashboard"

### Next session starts with
Fix location cascade first — covers #3, #28, #32, #33, #34 across register.html and register-spa.html. Read this file and Dev Plan before any code. Discuss and agree approach before any brief.
*STANDALONE — this file contains everything needed to start any session without any other document.*

## Session Log — 10 June 2026 (Session 2)

### What we did
- Switched to Claude Fable 5 (claude.ai + Claude Code default;
  included until 22 June - revert default after)
- Diagnosed location cascade across register.html,
  register-spa.html, dashboard.html - findings logged below
- Recovered pre-crash dashboard.html from git commit c778baa
- #26 root cause: rebuilt dashboard had NO login/session code,
  hard-redirected to index.html on every visit
- Transplanted OTP/session login from pre-crash file (ba7b966)
- Fixed auth-timing race: session check waits for
  onAuthStateChanged; session never deleted on read errors
  (38f8310)
- #26 VERIFIED FIXED in browser: return visit straight to
  dashboard, no OTP; OTP only after sign-out

### Diagnosis findings (cascade - fix not yet done)
- #32: silent query-failure path + no save validation +
  'none' sentinel leakage
- #33: regression, NOT new decision - spec was always both
  area+suburb visible, selecting one clears the other
- #34: saves doc IDs for province/area, display name for
  suburb - mixed formats
- #28: dashboard has NO cascade at all - must be built
- Cascade duplicated byte-identical in both register files
- Dead buildFormData() in both register files - remove later

### Decisions made
1. #26 fix: restore from git, transplant, adapt to doc-ID
   architecture
2. Lesson locked: NEVER rebuild a working file from scratch -
   restore from git, then clean
3. #33 reclassified as regression
4. NEW ISSUE: Sign Out misaligned - suppliers will tap it
   after every edit, killing session. Proposed Done button
   (keeps session) + small Sign Out link. NOT YET APPROVED.
5. Dashboard hamburger is a bug - remove (not yet done)
6. Product behaviour must be documented before briefs -
   supplier journey doc next session

### Parked items (carry forward)
- Location cascade fix briefs (#3/#28/#32/#33/#34) - pending:
  name+ID vs name only; shared file vs fix twice
- Dashboard cascade build (#28)
- Sign Out / Done redesign - awaiting Johan
- Dashboard hamburger removal
- reCAPTCHA dev throttling - Firebase test-mode skip
- dashboard-precrash.html (untracked, reference) - delete
  after cascade fixes
- Dead buildFormData() removal
- index.html dark theme - Phase D
- draw.io install + supplier journey doc - NEXT SESSION START

### Git
- ba7b966 - Fix #26: restore OTP/session login (c778baa)
- 38f8310 - Fix #26 part 2: session check waits for auth
- Both pushed

### GitHub Issues
- #26: fixed and verified - close when Johan confirms
- New to log: dashboard hamburger removal; Sign Out/Done

### Next session starts with
draw.io install -> supplier journey doc (plain text, Johan's
words) -> Sign Out/Done decision -> cascade fix briefs
